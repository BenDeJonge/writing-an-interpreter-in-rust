A Rust implementation of the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
See also [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rydgel/monkey-rust).

This repo documents my educational read-through of the book, in order to learn more about Rust and what the hell is actually going on when I execute code.
